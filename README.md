# Firefox Profiler

[![Matrix][matrix-badge]][matrix]

The [Firefox Profiler] visualizes performance data recorded from web browsers. It is a tool designed to consume performance profiles from the Gecko Profiler but can visualize data from any profiler able to output in JSON. The interface is a web application built using [React] and [Redux] and runs entirely client-side.

[Mozilla] develops this tool to help make [Firefox] silky smooth and fast for millions of its users, and to help make sites and apps faster across the web.

### Usage

> Visit [profiler.firefox.com](https://profiler.firefox.com/) :rocket:

This project is live on [https://profiler.firefox.com/](https://profiler.firefox.com/). The website includes instructions on how to get going to start recording and viewing performance profiles.

### Accessibility: Assistive technology support

The Profiler was tested with recent versions of the following assistive technology:

[NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (Windows) on Firefox and Chrome browsers </br>
[VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/) (Mac OS X) on Chrome</br>
[Orca](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Orca?action=show&redirect=Orca) (Linux) on Firefox

If you experience problems using any of the above technologies, please file a bug.

If you would like to help us test on other assistive technologies or improve the existing code, we would love your contributions!

### Development

You will need a recent enough version of [Yarn 1 (Classic)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/),
version 1.10 is known to work correctly.
You can install it using `npm install -g yarn`. Please refer to [its documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for other possible install procedures.

To download and build the Firefox Profiler web app run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:firefox-devtools/profiler.git
cd profiler
yarn install
yarn start
```

This project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

You can also develop the Firefox Profiler online in a pre-configured development environment.
