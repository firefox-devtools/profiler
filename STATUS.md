# Flow to TypeScript Migration Status

This document tracks the current status of the Flow to TypeScript migration. It describes completed steps, ongoing work, and next actions.

## Phase 1 & 2: Infrastructure and Flow Cleanup - COMPLETED ✅

**Completed:** January 2025

### Major Accomplishments
- ✅ **TypeScript Infrastructure**: Complete build system setup with TypeScript support
- ✅ **Flow Exact Object Cleanup**: Converted 1,132 exact object types `{||}` → `{}` across 240 files
- ✅ **Type Compatibility Layer**: Created global.d.ts with Flow→TypeScript compatibility aliases
- ✅ **Automation Scripts**: Built migrate-exact-objects.sh for systematic syntax conversion
- ✅ **Testing Validation**: All existing tests continue to pass after changes

### Technical Details
- **Commit 056546015**: TypeScript infrastructure and build system setup
- **Commit d2e53a121**: Systematic exact object type conversion across entire codebase
- **Files Modified**: 240+ files with pure syntax transformation
- **Build Compatibility**: Maintains both Flow and TypeScript compilation paths

## Current Status: Type Definitions Migration In Progress

### Build & Test Status
- **Build**: ✅ Working (`yarn build` passes)
- **Tests**: ✅ All pass (`yarn test` - full test suite)
- **Flow**: ⚠️ Some expected errors due to exact object changes (migration in progress)
- **TypeScript**: ✅ Compiles successfully for .ts/.tsx files

### Migration Readiness Assessment

| Component | Status | Risk Level | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Connected Components** | ✅ Ready | Medium | Will migrate existing ExplicitConnect patterns as-is |
| **Flow Type Cleanup** | ✅ Partially Complete | Medium | Exact objects done, readonly properties remain |
| **Build System** | ✅ Complete | Low | TypeScript fully integrated |
| **File Conversion** | ✅ Ready | Medium | Can begin .js → .ts/.tsx conversion |
| **Per-thread Selectors** | ⚠️ Complex | High | Will require careful manual migration |

### Current Progress Tracking

**✅ Phase 1 & 2 - Infrastructure & Flow Cleanup** (COMPLETED)
- [x] 100% - TypeScript build system setup 
- [x] 100% - Global type compatibility layer
- [x] 100% - Exact object type conversion (1,132 instances)
- [x] 100% - Flow readonly properties approach (discarded - see lessons learned)

**🔄 Phase 3 - File-by-File Migration** (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] 0% - Core utility files (.js → .ts)
- [x] 20% - Type definition files (.js → .ts) - units.ts, utils.ts, store.ts, index.ts converted
- [ ] 0% - React components (.js → .tsx)
- [ ] 0% - Test files migration

**⏳ Phase 4 - Advanced Type Fixes** (PENDING)
- [ ] 0% - Per-thread selector types
- [ ] 0% - Connected component types
- [ ] 0% - Complex union/intersection types

**⏳ Phase 5 - Final Validation** (PENDING)
- [ ] 0% - Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] 0% - Flow infrastructure removal
- [ ] 0% - Documentation updates

## Migration Statistics

### Completed Work
- **Exact Objects Converted**: 1,132 instances (`{||}` → `{}`)
- **TypeScript Files Converted**: 4 type definition files (units.ts, utils.ts, store.ts, index.ts)
- **Files Modified**: 240+ files across entire codebase
- **Build System**: Fully functional dual Flow/TypeScript compilation
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of existing tests still pass after each conversion

### Remaining Work  
- **Type Definition Files**: ~10 remaining in src/types/ (actions.js, state.js, etc.)
- **Files to Convert**: ~250 .js files → .ts/.tsx
- **Flow Syntax**: Per-file conversion during .js → .ts migration
- **Complex Types**: Per-thread selectors, exact patterns

### Target Architecture
- **File Extensions**: .ts for utilities, .tsx for React components  
- **Type Strategy**: Gradual strictness increase
- **Compatibility**: Global aliases maintain Flow→TypeScript bridge during transition

## Lessons Learned & Approach Changes

### Readonly Properties Strategy
**Original Plan**: Convert all Flow `+prop:` syntax to TypeScript `readonly prop:` globally  
**Approach Tried**: Used regex replacement across 1,795 instances in 156 files  
**Result**: FAILED - Flow parser couldn't handle TypeScript `readonly` keyword  
**Lesson**: Global syntax changes don't work in mixed Flow/TypeScript codebase

**New Approach**: Convert readonly properties during individual file .js → .ts conversion
- **Benefits**: Each file gets proper TypeScript syntax when it becomes a .ts file
- **Safer**: No risk of breaking Flow parser for remaining .js files

### Type-First Migration Strategy  
**Original Plan**: Start with utility files  
**New Approach**: Start with type definition files in src/types/  
**Benefits**:
- Type definitions provide foundation for other files
- Simple type-only files are easiest to convert
- Other files can import from .ts type files without issues
- Builds confidence in conversion process

### Connected Components Strategy
**Original Plan**: Wait for PR #3063/#3064 to modernize connect API  
**Current Approach**: Migrate existing `ExplicitConnect` patterns to TypeScript as-is, then refactor later

**Benefits**:
- Removes external dependency blocker
- Allows immediate progress on file conversion
- Provides working TypeScript types for current patterns

### Risk Mitigation
- **Per-thread Selectors**: Will tackle these manually with careful testing
- **Build Performance**: Monitoring TypeScript compilation impact
- **Type Safety**: Gradual strictness increase prevents overwhelming errors

## Next Steps (Current - Next 1-2 weeks)

### Phase 3: File-by-File Migration (Revised Order)
1. **Complete Type Definitions** (IN PROGRESS):
   - ✅ Converted: units.ts, utils.ts, store.ts, index.ts
   - 🔄 **Next**: Convert remaining src/types/*.js files (actions.js, state.js, etc.)
   - Convert complex type files with Flow-specific patterns
   - Test that all type imports work correctly

2. **Move to Core Utilities**:
   - Convert `src/utils/*.js` → `.ts` (builds on type foundation)
   - Start with simple utility files without complex dependencies
   - Validate import/export patterns work correctly

3. **Begin Component Migration**:
   - Start with simple leaf components (no complex Redux connections)
   - Convert `.js` → `.tsx` with proper React types
   - Validate that component props and state work correctly

4. **Connected Components**:
   - Add TypeScript types to existing `ExplicitConnect` usage
   - Create typed versions of selectors and actions
   - Test that Redux connections work with TypeScript

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass  
- [ ] No runtime regressions in core profiler functionality
- [ ] Development and production builds work correctly
- [ ] Team productivity maintained during migration

## Documentation Status

- ✅ **PLAN.md**: Comprehensive migration strategy completed
- ✅ **TODO.md**: Detailed actionable tasks with priorities
- ✅ **STATUS.md**: Current status tracking (this document)
- ⏳ **CLAUDE.md**: Will need updates to reflect TypeScript development setup
