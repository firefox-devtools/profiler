        We tried to open an existing published profiles store database with a
        smaller version than the current one. We can't do that with IndexedDB.
        The only way to recover is to delete the database and create a new one,
        but we don't want to do this automatically.
        Until this is fixed we won't be able to store newly published profiles
        or retrieve previously published profiles.

        If you want to delete the database, you can do so by running 'deleteDB()'
        in the console, or using the developer tools.
