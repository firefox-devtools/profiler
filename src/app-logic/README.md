# Application logic - /src/app-logic

Most of the application logic is contained in reducers (`reducers/app.ts` or
`reducers/profile-view.ts` usually).

Therefore this folder is for when we need to extract some business logic, either
because it's complicated or because it needs to be shared across the
application.
