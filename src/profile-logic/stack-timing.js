/**
 * The StackTimingByDepth data structure organizes stack frames by their depth, and start
 * and end times. This optimizes sample data for Stack Chart views. It
 * makes it really easy to draw a large amount of boxes at once based on where the
 * viewport is in the stack frame data. Plus the end timings for frames need to be
 * reconstructed from the sample data, as the samples only contain start timings.
 *
 * This format allows for specifically selecting certain rows of stack frames by using
 * the stack depth information. In addition, the start and end times of samples can be
 * found through binary searches, allowing for selecting the proper subsets of frames
 * to be drawn. Each row's sample length is different, but it can still be efficient
 * to find subsets of the data.
 *
 * Each object in the array below represents a single row of stack frames at a given
 * depth. Each object is a table that contains the the start time and end time in
 * milliseconds, and the stack index that points into the stack table.
 *
 * Here is a tree example:
 *
 * This table shows off how a stack chart gets filtered to JS only, where the number is
 * the stack index, and P is platform code, and J javascript.
 *
 *   0-10-20-30-40-50-60-70-80-90-91 <- Timing (ms)
 *    0-----1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8   <- same width indexes
 *  ================================
 *     0P 0P 0P 0P 0P 0P 0P 0P 0P  |
 *     1P 1P 1P    1P 1P 1P 1P 1P  |
 *     2P 2P 3P       4J 4J 4J 4J  |
 *                       5J 5J     |
 *                          6P     |
 *                          7P     |
 *                          8J     |
 *
 * Note that stacks 10 and 20 in the unfiltered tree are the same, therefore
 * they'll form just one "same width" stack.
 * It's easier to think of the "same widths" indexes as the space between each
 * new stack.
 *
 * stackTimingByDepth Example:
 * [
 *   // This first object represents the first box at the base of the chart. It only
 *   // contains a single stack frame to draw, starting at 10ms, ending at 100ms. It
 *   // points to the stackIndex 0.
 *
 *   {start: [10], end: [91], sameWidthsStart: [0], sameWidthsEnd: [8], stack: [0], length: 1},
 *
 *   // This next object represents 2 boxes to draw, the first box being stack 1 in the
 *   // stack table, and it starts at 10ms, and ends at 40ms.
 *   {start: [10, 50], end: [40, 91], sameWidthsStart: [0, 3], sameWidthsEnd: [2, 8], stack: [1, 1], length: 2},
 *
 *   // This next object represents 3 boxes to draw, the first box being stack 2 in the
 *   // stack table, and it starts at 10ms, and ends at 30ms.
 *   {start: [10, 30, 60], end: [30, 40, 91], sameWidthsStart: [0, 1, 4], sameWidthsEnd: [1, 2, 8], stack: [2, 3, 4], length: 3},
 *   {start: [70], end: [90], sameWidthsStart: [5], sameWidthsEnd: [7], stack: [5], length: 1},
 *   ...
 * ]
 *
 * As a result of the computation, getStackTimingByDepth also returns a mapping
 * between the same widths indexes and the corresponding times. This is a normal
 * array. In the previous example, it would have 8 elements and look like this:
 *    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   <- indexes
 *   [10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 91] <- timings
 * This array makes it easy to find the boxes to draw for a preview selection.

  // Overview of the algorithm:
  // We go sample by sample.
  // At the end of each iteration, we have a stack of "open boxes" which are
  // available for sharing with the next sample; each open box has a call node
  // and a start time. The number of open boxes matches the length of the call
  // path.
  // At the beginning of each iteration, we pick which of the open boxes from
  // the previous sample we want to share (these boxes remain "open") and which
  // ones we can't share.
  // The ones we can't share need to be "committed", i.e. added to stackTimingByDepth.
  // We share the boxes whose call nodes are ancestors of the current sample's
  // call node, and commit the rest. Then we open new boxes for the unshared part
  // of the current sample's call node path.

  // We remember the stack of open boxes by remembering only the deepest call
  // node; and the start time for each box in the stack.
  // The call nodes of the remaining "open boxes" are implicit; i.e. the call
  // node of the open box at depth d is the ancestor at depth d of
