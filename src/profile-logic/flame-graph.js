/**
 * FlameGraphRows is an array of rows, where each row is an array of call node
 * indexes. This is a timing-invariant representation of the flame graph and can
 * be cached independently of the sample / timing information.
 *
 * When combined with the timing information, it is used to produce FlameGraphTiming.
 *
 * In FlameGraphRows, rows[depth] contains all the call nodes of that depth.
 * The call nodes are ordered in the same order that they'll be displayed in the
 * flame graph:
 *
 *  - Siblings are ordered by function name.
 *  - Siblings are grouped, i.e. all nodes with the same prefix are next to each other.
 *  - The order of these groups with respect to each other is determined by how
 *    their prefix call nodes are ordered in the previous row.
 *
 * # Example ([call node index] [function name])
 *
 * ```
 *  - 0 A
 *    - 1 D
 *      - 2 I
 *    - 3 B
 *      - 4 C
 *      - 5 F
 *      - 6 E
 *    - 7 G
 *  - 8 H
 * ```
 *
 * The call node table above produces the following FlameGraphRows:
 * Depth 0: [0, 8]       // ["A", "H"]
 * Depth 1: [3, 1, 7]    // ["B", "D", "G"]
 * Depth 2: [4, 6, 5, 2] // ["C", "E", "F", "I"]
 *
 * Note that [4, 6, 5] are the children of 3 ("B"), sorted by name, and these
 * children have been moved before 2 ("I") to match the order of their parents.
