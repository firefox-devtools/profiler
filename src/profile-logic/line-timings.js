/**
 * For each stack in `stackTable`, and one specific source file, compute the
 * sets of line numbers in file that are hit by the stack.
 *
 * For each stack we answer the following question:
 *  - "Does this stack contribute to line X's self time?"
 *       Answer: result.selfLine[stack] === X
 *  - "Does this stack contribute to line X's total time?"
 *       Answer: result.stackLines[stack].has(X)
 *
 * Compute the sets of line numbers in the given file that are hit by each stack.
 * For each stack in the stack table and each line in the file, we answer the
 * question "Does this stack contribute to line X's self time? Does it contribute
 * to line X's total time?"
 * Each stack can only contribute to one line's self time: the line of the stack's
 * own frame.
 * But each stack can contribute to the total time of multiple lines: All the lines
 * in the file that are encountered by any of the stack's ancestor stacks.
 * E.g if functions A, B and C are all in the same file, then a stack with the call
 * path [A, B, C] will contribute to the total time of 3 lines:
 *   1. The line in function A which has the call to B,
 *   2. The line in function B which has the call to C, and
 *   3. The line in function C that is being executed at that stack (stack.frame.line).
 *
 * This last line is the stack's "self line".
 * If there is recursion, and the same line is present in multiple frames in the
 * same stack, the line is only counted once - the lines are stored in a set.
 *
 * The returned StackLineInfo is computed as follows:
 *   selfLine[stack]:
 *     For stacks whose stack.frame.func.file is the given file, this is stack.frame.line.
 *     For all other stacks this is null.
 *   stackLines[stack]:
 *     For stacks whose stack.frame.func.file is the given file, this is the stackLines
 *     of its prefix stack, plus stack.frame.line added to the set.
 *     For all other stacks this is the same as the stackLines set of the stack's prefix.

/**
 * This function handles the non-inverted case of getStackLineInfoForCallNode.
 *
 * Gathers the line numbers which are hit by a given call node.
 * These line numbers are in the source file that contains that call node's func.
 *
 * This is best explained with an example.
 * Let the call node be the node for the call path [A, B, C].
 * Let this be the stack tree:
 *
 *  - stack 1, func A
 *    - stack 2, func B
 *      - stack 3, func C, line 30
 *      - stack 4, func C, line 40
 *    - stack 5, func B
 *      - stack 6, func C, line 60
 *      - stack 7, func C, line 70
 *        - stack 8, func D
 *      - stack 9, func E
 *    - stack 10, func F
 *
 * This maps to the following call tree:
 *
 *  - call node 1, func A
 *    - call node 2, func B
 *      - call node 3, func C
 *        - call node 4, func D
 *      - call node 5, func E
 *   - call node 6, func F
 *
 * The call path [A, B, C] uniquely identifies call node 3.
 * The following stacks all "collapse into" ("map to") call node 3:
 * stack 3, 4, 6 and 7.
 * Stack 8 maps to call node 4, which is a child of call node 3.
 * Stacks 1, 2, 5, 9 and 10 are outside the call path [A, B, C].
 *
 * In this function, we only compute "line hits" that are contributed to
 * the given call node.
 * Stacks 3, 4, 6 and 7 all contribute their time both as "self time"
 * and as "total time" to call node 3, at the line numbers 30, 40, 60,
 * and 70, respectively.
 * Stack 8 also hits call node 3 at line 70, but does not contribute to
 * call node 3's "self time", it only contributes to its "total time".
 * Stacks 1, 2, 5, 9 and 10 don't contribute to call node 3's self or total time.
 *
 * All stacks can contribute no more than one line in the given call node.
 * This is different from the getStackLineInfo function above, where each
 * stack can hit many lines in the same file, because all of the ancestor
 * stacks are taken into account, rather than just one of them. Concretely,
 * this means that in the returned StackLineInfo, each stackLines[stack]
 * set will only contain at most one element.
 *
 * The returned StackLineInfo is computed as follows:
 *   selfLine[stack]:
 *     For stacks that map to the given call node, this is stack.frame.line.
 *     For all other stacks this is null.
 *   stackLines[stack]:
 *     For stacks that map to the given call node or one of its descendant
 *     call nodes, this is a set containing one element, which is
 *     ancestorStack.frame.line, where ancestorStack maps to the given call
 *     node.
 *     For all other stacks, this is null.
