/**
 * The `StackTable` type of the derived thread.
 *
 * The only difference from the `RawStackTable` is that the `StackTable` has a
 * `category` and a `subcategory` column.
 *
 * The category of a stack node is always non-null and is derived from a stack's
 * frame and its prefix. Frames can have null categories, stacks cannot. If a
 * stack's frame has a null category, the stack inherits the category of its
 * prefix stack. Root stacks whose frame has a null stack have their category
 * set to the "default category". (The default category is currently defined as
 * the category in the profile's category list whose color is "grey", and such
 * a category is required to be present.)
 *
 * We compute the category information at the start of the thread transform
 * pipeline, not at the end. This allows us to preserve categories more accurately
 * when transforms are applied. Example:
 *
 * In the call path
 *   someJSFunction [JS] -> Node.insertBefore [DOM] -> nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt,
 * the stack node for nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt should inherit the
 * category DOM from its "Node.insertBefore" prefix stack. And it should keep
 * the DOM category even if you apply the "Merge node into calling function"
 * transform to Node.insertBefore. This transform removes the stack node
 * "Node.insertBefore" from the stackTable, so the information about the DOM
 * category would be lost if it wasn't inherited into the
 * nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt stack before transforms are applied.

 * # Call node ordering
 *
 * Call nodes are ordered in depth-first traversal order. This makes it super fast
 * to check whether node A is a descendant of node B, because all subtrees are
 * a contiguous range of call node indexes.
 *
 * More details about the ordering:
 *
 *  - The node at index 0 is the first root node.
 *  - If a node A has children, then A + 1 is its first child.
 *  - If a node A has no children, then A + 1 is its next sibling, or the closest
 *    next sibling of an ancestor node if A doesn't have a next sibling.
 *  - For every node A, there's a single "index range" which contains this node
 *    and all its descendants: [A, callNodeTable.subtreeRangeEnd[A]).
 *  - This "tree of ranges" is well-nested.
 *  - The ordering of siblings doesn't have any meaning, i.e. it doesn't matter
 *    if a node is the first or the third child of its parent (they're not
 *    ordered by func or anything).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 *  - 0 funcG
 *    - 1 funcH
 *      - 2 funcI
 *      - 3 funcG
 *    - 4 funcJ
 *    - 5 funcI
 *  - 6 funcK
 *    - 7 funcG
 *      - 8 funcL
 *  - 9 funcH
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the index range of the subtree of node 0 is [0, 6).
 * The index range of the subtree of node 3 is [3, 4), i.e. the half-open range
 * which only contains node 3.
