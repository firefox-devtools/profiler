 * The `StackTable` type of the derived thread.

 *
 * The category of a stack node is always non-null and is derived from a stack's

 * prefix stack. Root stacks whose frame has a null stack have their category
 * set to the "default category". (The default category is currently defined as
 * the category in the profile's category list whose color is "grey", and such
 * a category is required to be present.)
 *
 * We compute the category information at the start of the thread transform
 * pipeline, not at the end. This allows us to preserve categories more accurately
 * when transforms are applied. Example:
 *
 * In the call path
 *   someJSFunction [JS] -> Node.insertBefore [DOM] -> nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt,
 * the stack node for nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt should inherit the
 * category DOM from its "Node.insertBefore" prefix stack. And it should keep
 * the DOM category even if you apply the "Merge node into calling function"
 * transform to Node.insertBefore. This transform removes the stack node
 * "Node.insertBefore" from the stackTable, so the information about the DOM
 * category would be lost if it wasn't inherited into the
 * nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt stack before transforms are applied.

 * # Call node ordering
 *
 * Call nodes are ordered in depth-first traversal order. This makes it super fast
 * to check whether node A is a descendant of node B, because all subtrees are
 * a contiguous range of call node indexes.
 *
 * More details about the ordering:
 *
 *  - The node at index 0 is the first root node.
 *  - If a node A has children, then A + 1 is its first child.
 *  - If a node A has no children, then A + 1 is its next sibling, or the closest
 *    next sibling of an ancestor node if A doesn't have a next sibling.
 *  - For every node A, there's a single "index range" which contains this node
 *    and all its descendants: [A, callNodeTable.subtreeRangeEnd[A]).
 *  - This "tree of ranges" is well-nested.
 *  - The ordering of siblings doesn't have any meaning, i.e. it doesn't matter
 *    if a node is the first or the third child of its parent (they're not
 *    ordered by func or anything).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 *  - 0 funcG
 *    - 1 funcH
 *      - 2 funcI
 *      - 3 funcG
 *    - 4 funcJ
 *    - 5 funcI
 *  - 6 funcK
 *    - 7 funcG
 *      - 8 funcL
 *  - 9 funcH
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the index range of the subtree of node 0 is [0, 6).
 * The index range of the subtree of node 3 is [3, 4), i.e. the half-open range
 * which only contains node 3.

 *
 * # The Suffix Order
 *
 * We define an alternative ordering of the *non-inverted* call nodes, called the
 * "suffix order", which is useful when interacting with the *inverted* tree.
 * The suffix order is stored by two Uint32Array side tables, returned by
 * getSuffixOrderedCallNodes() and getSuffixOrderIndexes().
 * getSuffixOrderedCallNodes() maps a suffix order index to a non-inverted call
 * node, and getSuffixOrderIndexes() is the reverse, mapping a non-inverted call
 * node to its suffix order index.
 *
 * ## Background
 *
 * Many operations we do in the profiler require the ability to do an efficient
 * "ancestor" check:
 *
 *  - For a call node X in the call tree, what's its "total"?
 *  - When call node X in the call tree is selected, which samples should be
 *    highlighted in the activity graph, and which samples should contribute to
 *    the category breakdown in the sidebar?
 *  - For how many samples has the clicked call node X been observed in a certain
 *    line of code / in a certain instruction?
 *
 * We answer these questions by iterating over samples, getting the sample's
 * call node Y, and checking whether the selected / clicked node X is an ancestor
 * of Y.
 *
 * In the non-inverted call tree, the ordering in the call node table gives us a
 * quick way to do these checks: For a call node X, all its descendant call nodes
 * are in a contiguous range between X and callNodeTable.subtreeRangeEnd[X].
 *
 * We want to have a similar ability for the *inverted* call tree, but without
 * computing a full inverted call node table. The suffix order gives us this
 * ability. It's based on the following insights:
 *
 *  1. Non-inverted call nodes are "enough" for many purposes even in inverted mode:
 *
 *     When doing the per-sample checks listed above, we don't need an *inverted*
 *     call node for each sample. We just need an inverted call node for the
 *     clicked / selected node, and then we can check if the sample's
 *     *non-inverted* call node contributes to the selected / clicked *inverted*
 *     call node.
 *     A non-inverted call node is just a representation of a call path. You can
 *     read that call path from front to back, or you can read it from back to
 *     front. If you read it from back to front that's the inverted call path.
 *
 *  2. We can store multiple different orderings of the non-inverted call node
 *     table.
 *
 *     The non-inverted call node table remains ordered in depth-first traversal
 *     order of the non-inverted tree, as described in the "Call node ordering"
 *     section on the CallNodeTable type. The suffix order is an additional,
 *     alternative ordering that we store on the side.
 *
 * ## Definition
 *
 * We define the suffix order as the lexicographic order of the inverted call path.
 * Or as the lexicographic order of the non-inverted call paths "when reading back to front".
 *
 * D -> B comes before A -> C, because B comes before C.
 * D -> B comes after A -> B, because B == B and D comes after A.
 * D -> B comes before A -> D -> B, because B == B, D == D, and "end of path" comes before A.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ### Non-inverted call tree:
 *
 * Legend:
 *
 * cnX: Non-inverted call node index X
 * soX: Suffix order index X
 *
 * ```
 *   Tree            Left aligned    Right aligned        Reordered by suffix
 * - [cn0] A      =  A            =            A [so0]    [so0] [cn0] A
 *   - [cn1] B    =  A -> B       =       A -> B [so3]    [so1] [cn4] A <- A
 *     - [cn2] A  =  A -> B -> A  =  A -> B -> A [so2] ↘↗ [so2] [cn2] A <- B <- A
 *     - [cn3] C  =  A -> B -> C  =  A -> B -> C [so6] ↗↘ [so3] [cn1] B <- A
 *   - [cn4] A    =  A -> A       =       A -> A [so1]    [so4] [cn5] B <- A <- A
 *     - [cn5] B  =  A -> A -> B  =  A -> A -> B [so4]    [so5] [cn6] C <- A
 *   - [cn6] C    =  A -> C       =       A -> C [so5]    [so6] [cn3] C <- B <- A
 * ```
 *
 * ### Inverted call tree:
 *
 * Legend, continued:
 *
 * inX:     Inverted call node index X
 * so:X..Y: Suffix order index range soX..soY (soY excluded)
 *
 * ```
 *                                                 Represents call paths ending in
 * - [in0] A  (so:0..3)        =  A             =            ... A (cn0, cn4, cn2)
 *   - [in1] A  (so:1..2)      =  A <- A        =       ... A -> A (cn4)
 *   - [in2] B  (so:2..3)      =  A <- B        =       ... B -> A (cn2)
 *     - [in3] A  (so:2..3)    =  A <- B <- A   =  ... A -> B -> A (cn2)
 * - [in4] B  (so:3..5)        =  B             =            ... B (cn1, cn5)
 *   - [in5] A  (so:3..5)      =  B <- A        =       ... A -> B (cn1, cn5)
 *     - [in6] A  (so:4..5)    =  B <- A <- A   =  ... A -> A -> B (cn5)
 * - [in7] C  (so:5..7)        =  C             =            ... C (cn6, cn3)
 *   - [in8] A  (so:5..6)      =  C <- A        =       ... A -> C (cn6)
 *   - [in9] B  (so:6..7)      =  C <- B        =       ... B -> C (cn3)
 *     - [in10] A  (so:6..7)   =  C <- B <- A   =  ... A -> B -> C (cn3)
 * ```
 *
 * In the suffix order, call paths become grouped in such a way that call paths
 * which belong to the same *inverted* tree node (i.e. which share a suffix) end
 * up ordered next to each other. This makes it so that a node in the inverted
 * tree can refer to all its represented call paths with a single contiguous range.
 *
 * In this example, inverted tree node `in5` represents all call paths which end
 * in A -> B. Both `cn1` and `cn5` do so; `cn1` is A -> B and `cn5` is A -> A -> B.
 * In the suffix order, `cn1` and `cn5` end up next to each other, at positions
 * `so3` and `so4`. This means that the two paths can be referred to via the suffix
 * order index range 3..5.
 *
 * Suffix ordered call nodes: [0, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 3] (soX -> cnY)
 * Suffix order indexes:      [0, 3, 2, 6, 1, 4, 5] (cnX -> soY)
 *
