 *
 *     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

 * Visual metrics are performance metrics that measure above-the-fold webpage visual performance,

 * metrics serves as additional metrics to the typical page-level metrics such as onLoad. Visual
 * metrics contains key metrics such as Speed Index, Perceptual Speed Index, and ContentfulSpeedIndex,
 * along with their visual progression. These properties find their way into the gecko profile through running
 * browsertime, which is a tool that lets you collect performance metrics of your website.
 * Browsertime provides the option of generating a gecko profile, which then embeds these visual metrics
 * into the geckoprofile. More information about browsertime can be found through https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime.
 * These values are generated only when browsertime is run with --visualMetrics.
 *
 * Most values from this object are generated by the python script https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/6e88284930c1d3ded8d9d95252d2e13c252d361c/browsertime/visualmetrics.py
 * Especially look at the function calculate_visual_metrics.
 * Then the script is called and the result processed from the JS files in https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/tree/6e88284930c1d3ded8d9d95252d2e13c252d361c/lib/video/postprocessing/visualmetrics

 * Finally they're inserted into the JSON profile in https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/6e88284930c1d3ded8d9d95252d2e13c252d361c/lib/firefox/webdriver/firefox.js#L215-L230
