# Profiling Firefox for Android

Two options are possible:

- [Remote Profiling Firefox for Android](./guide-remote-profiling.md) provides the most options but can be cumbersome to set up;
- [Profiling Firefox for Android directly on the device](./guide-profiling-android-directly-on-device.md) has fewer options but should be easier to set up.
