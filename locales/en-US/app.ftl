## CallNodeContextMenu
## This is used as a context menu for the Call Tree, Flame Graph and Stack Chart
## panels.

# Variables:
#   $fileName (String) - Name of the file to open.
CallNodeContextMenu--show-file = Show <strong>{ $fileName }</strong>

CallNodeContextMenu--transform-merge-function = Merge function
    .title =
        Merging a function removes it from the profile, and assigns its time to the
        function that called it. This happens anywhere the function was called in
        the tree.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-merge-call-node = Merge node only
    .title =
        Merging a node removes it from the profile, and assigns its time to the
        function’s node that called it. It only removes the function from that
        specific part of the tree. Any other places the function was called from
        will remain in the profile.

# This is used as the context menu item title for "Focus on function" and "Focus
# on function (inverted)" transforms.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function-title =
    Focusing on a function will remove any sample that does not include that
    function. In addition, it re-roots the call tree so that the function
    is the only root of the tree. This can combine multiple function call sites
    across a profile into one call node.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function = Focus on function
    .title = { CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function-title }
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function-inverted = Focus on function (inverted)
    .title = { CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function-title }
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-subtree = Focus on subtree only
    .title =
        Focusing on a subtree will remove any sample that does not include that
        specific part of the call tree. It pulls out a branch of the call tree,
        however it only does it for that single call node. All other calls
        of the function are ignored.

# This is used as the context menu item to apply the "Focus on category" transform.
# Variables:
#   $categoryName (String) - Name of the category to focus on.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-category = Focus on category <strong>{ $categoryName }</strong>
    .title =
        Focusing on the nodes that belong to the same category as the selected node,
        thereby merging all nodes that belong to another category.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-collapse-function-subtree = Collapse function
    .title =
        Collapsing a function will remove everything it called, and assign
        all of the time to the function. This can help simplify a profile that
        calls into code that does not need to be analyzed.

# This is used as the context menu item to apply the "Collapse resource" transform.
# Variables:
#   $nameForResource (String) - Name of the resource to collapse.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-collapse-resource =
    Collapse <strong>{ $nameForResource }</strong>
    .title =
        Collapsing a resource will flatten out all the calls to that
        resource into a single collapsed call node.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-collapse-recursion = Collapse recursion
    .title =
        Collapsing recursion removes calls that repeatedly recurse into
        the same function, even with intermediate functions on the stack.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-collapse-direct-recursion-only = Collapse direct recursion only
    .title =
        Collapsing direct recursion removes calls that repeatedly recurse into
        the same function with no intermediate functions on the stack.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-drop-function = Drop samples with this function
    .title =
        Dropping samples removes their time from the profile. This is useful to
        eliminate timing information that is not relevant for the analysis.

CallNodeContextMenu--expand-all = Expand all

# Searchfox is a source code indexing tool for Mozilla Firefox.
# See: https://searchfox.org/
CallNodeContextMenu--searchfox = Look up the function name on Searchfox

CallNodeContextMenu--show-the-function-in-devtools = Show the function in DevTools

## CallTree
## This is the component for Call Tree panel.

CallTree--tracing-ms-total = Running Time (ms)
    .title =
        The “total” running time includes a summary of all the time where this
        function was observed to be on the stack. This includes the time where
        the function was actually running, and the time spent in the callers from
        this function.
CallTree--tracing-ms-self = Self (ms)
    .title =
        The “self” time only includes the time where the function was
        the end of the stack. If this function called into other functions,
        then the “other” functions’ time is not included. The “self” time is useful
        for understanding where time was actually spent in a program.
CallTree--samples-total = Total (samples)
    .title =
        The “total” sample count includes a summary of every sample where this
        function was observed to be on the stack. This includes the time where the
        function was actually running, and the time spent in the callers from this
        function.
CallTree--samples-self = Self
    .title =
        The “self” sample count only includes the samples where the function was
        the end of the stack. If this function called into other functions,
        then the “other” functions’ counts are not included. The “self” count is useful
        for understanding where time was actually spent in a program.
CallTree--bytes-total = Total Size (bytes)
    .title =
        The “total size” includes a summary of all of the bytes allocated or
        deallocated while this function was observed to be on the stack. This
        includes both the bytes where the function was actually running, and the
        bytes of the callers from this function.
CallTree--bytes-self = Self (bytes)
    .title =
        The “self” bytes includes the bytes allocated or deallocated while this
        function was the end of the stack. If this function called into
        other functions, then the “other” functions’ bytes are not included.
        The “self” bytes are useful for understanding where memory was actually
        allocated or deallocated in the program.

## Call tree "badges" (icons) with tooltips
##
## These inlining badges are displayed in the call tree in front of some
## functions for native code (C / C++ / Rust). They're a small "inl" icon with
## a tooltip.

# Variables:
#   $calledFunction (String) - Name of the function whose call was sometimes inlined.
CallTree--divergent-inlining-badge =
    .title = Some calls to { $calledFunction } were inlined by the compiler.

# Variables:
#   $calledFunction (String) - Name of the function whose call was inlined.

    .title = Calls to { $calledFunction } were inlined into { $outerFunction } by the compiler.

## CallTreeSidebar
## This is the sidebar component that is used in Call Tree and Flame Graph panels.

CallTreeSidebar--select-a-node = Select a node to display information about it.
CallTreeSidebar--call-node-details = Call node details

## CallTreeSidebar timing information
##
## Firefox Profiler stops the execution of the program every 1ms to record the
## stack. Only thing we know for sure is the stack at that point of time when
## the stack is taken. We try to estimate the time spent in each function and
## translate it to a duration. That's why we use the "traced" word here.
## There is actually no difference between "Traced running time" and "Running
## time" in the context of the profiler. We use "Traced" to emphasize that this
## is an estimation where we have more space in the UI.
##
## "Self time" is the time spent in the function itself, excluding the time spent
## in the functions it called. "Running time" is the time spent in the function
## itself, including the time spent in the functions it called.

CallTreeSidebar--traced-running-time =
    .label = Traced running time
